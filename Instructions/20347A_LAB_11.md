  ```
  $Cred = Get-Credential
  $Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $Cred -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection 
  Import-PSSession $Session
  ```

3. Use the following command to set the IRM sharing location to the region you are in.

  ```
  Set-IRMConfiguration -RMSOnlineKeySharingLocation "https://sp-rms.eu.aadrm.com/TenantManagement/ServicePartner.svc"
  ```

  >  **Note:** Depending on the location of your tenant, replace the link in the preceding command with one of the following:
