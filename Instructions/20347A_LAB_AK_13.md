4. In the  **Event ID** column, verify that event ID **100** displays.

  >  **Note:** If the federation server is configured properly, you should see a new event with event ID 100 in the Event Viewer Application log. This event verifies that the federation server was able to communicate successfully with the Federation Service.

5. On LON-DC1, open Internet Explorer and connect to  **https://adfs.Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com/adfs/fs/federationserverservice.asmx**, replacing *Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com* with your unique Adatum domain name, and then press Enter. 

6. If you get a message stating  **There is a problem with this website's security certificate**, click  **Continue to this website**. 

  >  **Note:** The expected output is a display of XML with the service description document. If this page displays, then Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) on the federation server is operational and serving pages successfully.
  
  <!-- -->
  
>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have deployed the AD FS server in a federation server farm, and deployed the Web Application Proxy server to support AD FS.


## Exercise 2: Configuring federation with Microsoft Office 365
  
#### Task 1: Switch the Office 365 tenant to federated mode
  
1. Switch to the LON-DS1 virtual machine.

6. Click  **Users** and then click **Active Users**.

7. Click  **Holly Spencer**, and then, in the  **User name/Email Aliases** section, click **Edit**.

8. Change the primary email alias to  **Adatumyyxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com**. In the Warning window, click  **Save**, and then click  **Sign Out**.

9. Close Internet Explorer. 

  >  **Note:** Holly cannot change the Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com to a federated domain if she is logged in using an account from this domain. 

10. Click Start, and then click the  **Windows PowerShell** icon.

11. At the Windows PowerShell prompt, type the following commands, pressing Enter at the end of each line:

  ```
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -force
  Import-Module MSOnline
  ```

12. At the Windows PowerShell prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  $msolcred = Get-Credential
  ```

13. In the  **Windows PowerShell Credential** dialog box, enter the following credentials, and then click **OK**:

  ```
  Connect-MsolService -Credential $msolcred
  ```

15. At the Windows PowerShell prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Get-MsolDomain
  ```

16. Verify that your lab domain, Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com, is listed as  **Verified and Managed**.

  >  **Note:** If you were running this from a computer other than the AD FS federation server, you would need to use the **Set-MsolAdfsContext** to reference the AD FS server.

17. At the Windows PowerShell prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Convert-MsolDomainToFederated -DomainName Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com
  ```

18. Verify that you get a  **Successfully updated Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com domain** message.

19. At the Windows PowerShell prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Get-MsolFederationProperty -DomainName Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com
  ```

  >  **Note:** This command reports the status of the domain federation, and provides details of URLs and certificates.
  
<!-- -->

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have enabled a federation trust between your on-premises Active Directory domain and Office 365 through your AD FS federation server, and you should have converted your domain for federated authentication in Office 365.


## Exercise 3: Verifying single sign-on (SSO)
  
#### Task 1: Verify SSO for internal users
