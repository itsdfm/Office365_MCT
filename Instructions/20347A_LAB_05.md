## Exercise 2: Managing user-driven Office 365 ProPlus installations
  
### Scenario
  
As part of the pilot project, you need to understand the process of installing Office 365 ProPlus directly from the Office 365 portal. You must also explore options for managing the installation. A. Datum Corporation plans to use a combination of user-driven and managed deployments, depending on the employment relationship and working practices of individual users. Associates, those who have brought their own devices, and remote employees will all install Office 365 ProPlus manually from the Office 365 website. Holly, the administrator, will then determine what happens to users when she activates and deactivates Office 365 ProPlus subscriptions. She will also explore the different ways licensing effects the user.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Managing user rights to install Office 365 ProPlus

2. Installing Office 365 ProPlus from the Office 365 portal

3. Managing office licenses

4. Reactivating Office 365 ProPlus



#### Task 1: Managing user rights to install Office 365 ProPlus
  
1. On  **LON-CL1**, if required, connect to the **Office 365 admin center** as **Holly** with the password you created in Module 1 to assign various combinations of licensing to Office 365 users.

2. Edit user  **Abbi Skinner** by adding **Office 365 Enterprise E5** license using a location of **United Kingdom**, but removing the Office 365 ProPlus option.

3. Edit user **Beth Burke** and assign an **Office 365 Enterprise E5** license using the location of the **United Kingdom**.

4. Repeat the previous step for  **Cai Chu**.

5. In the Office 365 admin center, on the  **Settings** menu, access the **Apps** page.

6. On the  **Software download settings** page, disable downloads for Office 2016.

7. Sign out, and then sign in as Abbi Skinner with the username  **Abbi@AdatumYYXXXXX.hostdomain.com** and the password **Pa55w.rd**.

8. Access Abbi's Office 365 settings and verify that she does not have the option to install the Office 365 apps. 

9. Sign out as Abbi Skinner, and then sign in as  Beth with the username **beth@AdatumYYXXXXX.hostdomain.com** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

10. Navigate to the  **Office 365 settings** page, and then click **Install software**.

11. Note that the users looked similar, but Abbi is not assigned a license. Beth has a license, but Holly deactivated version 2016 for all users.

12. Before signing out, verify that  **Phone &amp; tablet** apps are available.

13. Sign out as Beth and close the browser.

14. Open a new browser, and then sign in to the Office 365 environment with the administrator Holly's credentials and password.
