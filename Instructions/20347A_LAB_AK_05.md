#### Task 2: Modify an Office 365 ProPlus installation
  
1. In this step, you will back up the Office 16  **configuration.xml** file and then open it so that you can edit it in the next step. To do this, perform the following steps:

  <Language ID="en-us" />
  </Product>
  ```

  <Language ID="en-us" />
  </Product>
  -->
  ```

6. In **Notepad**, click **File**, **Save As** and change the **File name:** to:  **AdatumConfiguration.xml**, change the **Save as type:** to **All Files**, and then click **Save**.

  >  **Note:** Be sure the **Adatumconfiguration** file has the **.xml** file extension, not **.xml.txt**!

7. Switch to File Explorer (you should still be in the **C:\Office16** folder), press **Shift** and **right-click** any white space below the file list, and then click  **Open command window here**. 

8. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:
