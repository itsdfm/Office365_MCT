# Module 6: Planning and managing Exchange Online recipients and permissions
# Lab: Managing Exchange Online recipients and permissions
  
### Scenario
  
 A. Datum Corporation is ready to move the second group of pilot users to Office 365. Before completing the move, you must ensure that you can manage Exchange recipients in Exchange Online. You also must ensure that you can delegate permissions in Exchange Online.


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to: 

- Configure Exchange Online recipients.
- Delegate administrative permissions.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Use the lab steps provided by the hosting partner when completing the labs in this course.

### Lab setup

User name:  **Adatum\\Administrator, Adatum\\Holly**

Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

In all tasks:

- Where you see references to  **AdatumYY _XXXX_.hostdomain.com**, replace  **AdatumYY _XXXX_** with your unique Office 365 Name displayed in the online lab portal.
- Where you see references to  **yourdomain.hostdomain.com**, replace the  **AdatumYY _XXXX_**with your unique hostdomain.com Name displayed in the online lab portal.


This lab requires the following virtual machines: (use only the VMs required for your lab)

- LON-DC1

  - Sign in as  **Adatum\\Administrator** using the password **Pa55w.rd**

- LON-DS1

  - Sign in as  **Adatum\\Administrator** using the password **Pa55w.rd**

## Exercise 1: Configuring Exchange Online recipients
  
### Scenario
  
In preparation for migrating more users to Office 365, you need to ensure that you can manage Exchange Online recipients by using the Exchange admin center and Windows PowerShell.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create user mailboxes

2. Connect to Exchange Online with Windows PowerShell

3. Create groups and assign members

4. Create resource mailboxes

5. Configure additional Exchange Online recipients



#### Task 1: Create user mailboxes
  
1. On LON-CL1, in Internet Explorer, navigate to https://portal.office.com/ and sign in as  **holly@yourdomain.hostdomain.com**, with the password you created in Module 1.

2. Open the Office 365 admin center. 

3. Create a new user, Martina Blair, with the following settings:

  - First name:  **Martina**
  - Last name:  **Blair**
  - Display name:  **Martina Blair**
  - User name:  **Martina**
  - Domain:  **yourdomain.hostdomain.com**
  - Location:  **United Kingdom**
  - Password:  the password you created in Module 1
  - Make this user change their password when the first sign in:  **Not selected**
  - Roles:  **User (no administrator access)**
  - Product licenses:  **Office 365 Enterprise E5**

4. Create the following additional user accounts: 

  - Matt Villagomez (since Matt@adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com is in use, use the username MattV)
  - Olivia Emerson
  - Kendra Sexton

5. Verify that the new users appear in the Exchange admin center as mailboxes in recipients. 

  >  **Note:** It might take a few minutes for the mailboxes to appear. Click the refresh icon periodically until they do.


#### Task 2: Connect to Exchange Online with Windows PowerShell
  
1. On the desktop, right-click  **Windows Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell**, and then click  **Run as administrator**. 

  >  **Note:** You can copy and paste these commands into the virtual machine.

2. In the Windows PowerShell window, run the following cmdlet: 

  ```
  $credential = Get-Credential
  ```

3. Sign in as  **holly@yourdomain.hostdomain.com** with the password you created in Module 1.

4. In the Windows PowerShell window, run the following cmdlet: 

  ```
  Connect-MsolService -Credential $credential
  ```

5. In the Windows PowerShell window, run the following cmdlet: 

  ```
  $exchangeSession = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri "https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/" -Credential $credential -Authentication "Basic" -AllowRedirection
  ```

6. In the Windows PowerShell window, run the following cmdlet: 

  ```
  Import-PSSession $exchangeSession -DisableNameChecking
  ```

7. In the Windows PowerShell window, run the following cmdlet: 

  ```
  Get-AcceptedDomain
  ```

  >  **Note:** This command returns the list of accepted domains and verifies that you can connect to your Office 365 subscription.


#### Task 3: Create groups and assign members
  
1. In the Windows PowerShell window, type the following command and press Enter to create the IT with Olivia as a member:

  ```
  New-DistributionGroup -Name IT -Members Olivia
  ```

2. Repeat steps 1 to add the following additional groups and members: 

  - **Managers**
    Members:  **Martina**

  - **Development**
    Members:  **MattV**

  - **Sales**
    Members:  **Kendra**



#### Task 4: Create resource mailboxes
  
1. In the Exchange Admin center, open  **resources**. 

2. In the Windows PowerShell window, run the following cmdlet: 

  ```
  New-Mailbox -Name "Conference Room" -Room
  ```

3. In the Windows PowerShell window, run the following cmdlet: 

  ```
  Set-CalendarProcessing "Conference Room" -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept
  ```

4. In the Windows PowerShell window, run the following cmdlet: 

  ```
  New-Mailbox -Name "Demonstration Laptop" -Equipment
  ```

5. In the Windows PowerShell window, run the following cmdlet: 

  ```
  Set-CalendarProcessing "Demonstration Laptop" -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept
  ```

  >  **Note:** If you receive an error when you run the **Set-CalendarProcessing** cmdlet for either of these objects, wait a few moments and repeat.

6. In the Exchange Admin center, click  **Refresh**. You should be able to see both resources.

7. In the Windows PowerShell window, run the following cmdlet: 

  ```
  Set-Mailbox "Conference Room" -ResourceCapacity "25"
  ```

8. In Exchange Admin center, click  **Refresh**. You should be able to see the Capacity you configured in the details pane on the right.



#### Task 5: Configure additional Exchange Online recipients
  
1.  On LON-CL1, open **C:\\Labfiles\\ExternalContacts.csv**, review its contents, and close the file.

2. In Exchange admin center, click  **contacts**. 

3. In the Windows PowerShell window, run the following cmdlet: 

  ```
  CD C:\Labfiles
  ```

  >  **Note:** You can copy and paste these commands into the virtual machine.

4. In the Windows PowerShell window, run the following cmdlet: 

  ```
