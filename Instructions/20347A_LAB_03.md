# Module 3: Configuring client connectivity to Microsoft Office 365
# Lab: Configuring client connectivity to Office 365
  
### Scenario
  
 You configured the Office 365 tenant and the custom domain for A. Datum Corporation. You also created user accounts for your pilot users. The next step you must perform is to ensure that clients can connect to Office 365, and that their configuration is automatic, where possible. To enable these features, you must configure the required DNS records for your custom domain, and use the Office 365 connectivity tools to verify connectivity. You then must configure Office 2016 clients to connect to Office 365.


### Objectives
  
 After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure DNS records for Office 365.

- Run Office 365 connectivity analyzer tools.

- Configure and verify client connectivity.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Use the lab steps provided by the hosting partner when completing the labs in this course.

### Lab setup
  
 Estimated Time: 60 minutes

Virtual machine:  **20347A-LON-DC1**,  **20347A-LON-CL1**, and  **20347A-LON-CL2**

 Username:  **Adatum\\Administrator**, **Adatum\\Holly**, **LON-CL2\\Francisco**

 Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

 In all of the tasks:

- When you see references to  **AdatumYYXXXX.onmicrosoft.com**, replace  **AdatumYYXXXX** with your unique Office 365 name that is displayed in the online lab portal.

- Where you see references to  **AdatumYYXXXX.hostdomain.com**, replace the  **AdatumYYXXXX** with your unique hostdomain.com name that is displayed in the online lab portal.


 This lab requires the following virtual machines: 

- LON-DC1

    - Sign in as  **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**

- LON-CL1

    - Sign in as  **Adatum\\Holly** with the password **Pa55w.rd**

- LON-CL2

  - Sign in as  **LON-CL2\\Francisco** with the password **Pa55w.rd**



## Exercise 1: Configuring DNS records for Office 365 clients
  
### Scenario
  
 All users in the pilot group at A. Datum are going to use the custom domain name in their email address and sign-in credentials. You want to ensure that these users can sign in and that clients are configured automatically, so you must configure the DNS records that the custom domain requires.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Review the recommended DNS records in the Office 365 admin center

2. Configure the DNS records for external clients



#### Task 1: Review the recommended DNS records in the Office 365 admin center
  
1. Switch to the LON-CL1 virtual machine.

2. On the desktop, open Microsoft Edge.

3. Connect to  **http://portal.office.com**, and then sign in as  **holly@adatumyyxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com.com**, replacing  *yyxxxxx* with your unique Adatum number, and using the password you created in Module 1.

4. In the Office 365 admin center, in the Domains window, review the domain names assigned to the  **Adatum** tenant.

5. In the Domains window, under the  **Adatum** domain on the right, review the recommended DNS records.

6. On the  **DNS errors** page, review the records that need to be configured for your domain.

7. Leave the Microsoft Edge window open. 



#### Task 2: Configure the DNS records for external clients
  
  **Configure DNS settings for Exchange Online**

1. On LON-DC1, start Server Manager, and then open the DNS Manager.

2. In DNS Manager, expand  **Forward Lookup Zones**, expand  **adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com** zone, and then create following records:


-  **Alias (CNAME)** - **autodiscover** - **autodiscover.outlook.com**

-  **Mail Exchanger (MX)** - - **adatumyyxxxxx-hostdomain-com.mail.protection.outlook.com**.


  **Configure DNS settings for Skype for Business Online**

3. On LON-DC1, in DNS Manager, expand the  **adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com** zone, and then create following service (SRV) records:

On the  **Service Location (SRV)** tab, enter the following information, and then click **OK**:


- Service:  **\_sip**

- Protocol:  **\_tls**

- Priority:  **100**

- Weight:  **1**

- Port number:  **443**

- Host offering this service:  **sipdir.online.lync.com**

- Time to live:  **1 hour (default)**

On the  **Service Location (SRV)** tab, enter the following information, and then click **OK**:


  - Service:  **\_sipfederationtls**

  - Protocol:  **\_tcp**

  - Priority:  **100**

  - Weight:  **1**

  - Port number:  **5061**

  - Host offering this service:  **sipfed.online.lync.com**

  - Time to live:  **1 hour (default)**


4. In DNS Manager, create the following  **Alias (CNAME)** records:

On the  **Alias (CNAME)** tab, enter the following information, and then click **OK**:


  - Alias name:  **sip**

  - Fully qualified domain name:  **sip.adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**

  - Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for target host:  **sipdir.online.lync.com**

  - Time to live:  **1 hour (default)**

On the  **Alias (CNAME)** tab, enter the following information, and then click **OK**:


  - Alias name:  **lyncdiscover**

  - Fully qualified domain name:  **lyncdiscover.adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**

  - Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for target host:  **webdir.online.lync**

  - Time to live:  **1 hour (default)**


5. Switch back to LON-CL1, and then in the  **Office 365 admin** console, click **Check DNS**.

6. You should now see that most records are not listed anymore (you should see msoid, enterpriseregistration, enterpriseenrollment, and SPF records). Click to close the page.

7. In the top bar, click the  **Office 365** apps icon.

8. Click  **Mail**, and configure your time zone.

9. On LON-CL2, verify that you are signed in as Francisco. 

10. Open Microsoft Edge, and then connect to  **https://portal.office.com**.

11. Sign in as  **Francisco@adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com** with the password you created in Module 1

12. In the Office 365 portal, click  **Mail**, and configure your time zone.

13. Create a new email to  **Holly Spencer**.

14. When the name resolves, note her instant message (IM) status. It might take a couple of minutes for her status to update.

15. Initiate an IM session with Holly Spencer.

16. On LON-CL1, click the  **IM** dialog box.

17. Reply to the IM. Note that you now can send IMs between the two users.

18. Close both IM windows, and then close the Microsoft Edge windows on both virtual machines. 


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have:Reviewed the recommended DNS records in the Office 365 admin center.Configured the DNS records for external clients.Configured the DNS records for internal clients.
