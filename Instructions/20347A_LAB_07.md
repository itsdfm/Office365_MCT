# Module 7: Planning and configuring Exchange Online services
# Lab A: Configuring message transport in Exchange Online
  
### Scenario
  
The pilot project is going well at A. Datum Corporation. However, before you finish the pilot project and perform a full deployment, you need to confirm that you can configure Exchange Online settings to match the on-premises settings for options such as message transport.


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure message transport settings.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Use the lab steps provided by the hosting partner when completing the labs in this course.

### Lab setup
  
Estimated Time: 35 minutes

Virtual machines:  **20347A-LON-DC1**, **20347A-LON-DS1**, **20347A-LON-CL1**, **20347A-LON-CL2**

User name:  **Adatum\\Administrator**, **Adatum\\Holly**, **LON-CL2\Francisco**

Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

In all tasks:

- Where you see references to  **AdatumYYXXXX.onmicrosoft.com**, replace  **AdatumYYXXXX** with your unique Office 365 Name that displays in the online lab portal.

- Where you see references to  **Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**, replace the *yyxxxxx* with your unique Adatum number, and replace the  *hostdomain.com* with your unique hostdomain.com Name that displays in the online lab portal.


Please use only the virtual machines that your lab requires. This lab requires the following virtual machines:

- LON-DC1

    - Sign in as  **Adatum\\Administrator** using the password **Pa55w.rd**

- LON-DS1

    - Sign in as  **Adatum\\Administrator** using the password **Pa55w.rd**

- LON-CL1

    - Sign in as  **Adatum\\Holly** using the password **Pa55w.rd**

- LON-CL2

    - Sign in as  **LON-CL2\\Francisco** using the password **Pa55w.rd**



## Exercise 1: Configuring message-transport settings
  
### Scenario
  
A. Datum has several email transport settings configured in their on-premises Exchange environment. You need to ensure that you also can configure the same settings in Exchange Online, including:

- A custom send and receive connector that will enforce TLS when sending email messages to, or receiving them from, a partner organization.
- A transport rule that will apply a disclaimer to all messages sent to external users
- A transport rule that requires moderator approval for all messages sent to the manager distribution list.
- A journal rule that will retain a copy of all messages sent to and from members of the Development department.


You also need to verify that you can track messages sent between users on Office 365 and sent to external users.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create a custom send and receive connector to enforce TLS

2. Create transport rules

3. Create a journal rule for members of the research department

4. Track internal and external message delivery


#### Task 1: Create a custom send and receive connector to enforce TLS
  
1. Use Microsoft Edge to sign in to Exchange admin center as  **Holly@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**, where *yyxxxxx* is your unique Adatum number, with the password you created in Module 1.

2. In the Exchange admin center, browse to  **connectors** in **mail flow**.

3. Create a new connector with the following settings:

  - Name:  **Humongous Insurance Outgoing**
  - From:  **Office 365**
  - To:  **Partner organization**
  - For email sent to:  **humongousinsurance.com**
  - Use MX records for delivery
  - Require TLS using a certificate from a trusted CA
  - Validation email:  **postmaster@humongousinsurance.com**

  >  **Note:** Validation of mail flow will fail because the connector is to a fictitious organization. This is expected behavior for this lab.

4. Create a new connector with the following settings:

  - Name:  **Humongous Insurance Incoming**
  - From:  **Partner organization**
  - To:  **Office 365**
  - For email received from:  **humongousinsurance.com**
  - Reject messages that do not use TLS



#### Task 2: Create transport rules
  
1. On LON-CL1, in the Exchange admin center, create a new disclaimer rule with the following settings:

  - Name:  **A. Datum Disclaimer**
  - Apply the rule if:  **The recipient is located Outside the organization**
  - Disclaimer text:  **&lt;HR&gt; If you are not the intended recipient of this message, you must delete it**

2. Create a new rule that sends messages to a moderator, with the following settings:

  - Name:  **Moderate Managers**
  - Apply the rule if:  **The recipient is a member of Managers**
  - Do the following:  **Forward the message for approval to Holly Spencer**

3. On LON-CL2, use Microsoft Edge to sign in to Outlook on the web as  **Francisco@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**, where *yyxxxxx* is your unique Adatum number, with the password you created in Module 1.

4. Send a message to **alias@outlook.com**, where alias@outlook.com is the Microsoft account that you configured at the beginning of this course, and then verify that the disclaimer was added.

5. Send a message to  **Martina** to test the moderation rule.

6. On LON-CL1, open Outlook 2016, read the approval request, and then approve it.



#### Task 3: Create a journal rule for members of the research department
  
1. On LON-CL1, in the Exchange admin center, browse to  **journal rules** in **compliance management**.

2. Configure undeliverable journal reports to be sent to Holly Spencer.

3. Create a new journal rule with the following settings:

  - Send journal reports to:  **journal@humongousinsurance.com**
  - Name:  **Development messages**
  - If the message is sent to or received from: the  **Development** group
  - Journal all messages



#### Task 4: Track internal and external message delivery
  
1. On LON-CL1, in the Exchange admin center, browse to  **message trace** in **mail flow**.

2. Perform a search with the default settings.

3. Review the most recent message sent from Francisco to  **alias@outlook.com**, and then verify that the disclaimer was applied.

4. Review the most recent message sent from **Francisco** to **Martina**, and then verify that the message was sent for moderation.


>  **Result**: After completing the exercise, you will have configured message-transport settings.



## 
  
**Question**

- PST migration

- Full hybrid configuration

**Question**

### Scenario
  
You also need to explore the anti-spam and antivirus settings that are available in Exchange Online, and you must

- Configure a policy to ensure that an administrator account is notified when Exchange Online receives a message that contains malware. 

- Ensure that internal users are notified when their messages are not delivered.

- Ensure that you can block all email from IP addresses that you specify.

- Ensure that Sales users receive all messages, even if there is a high likelihood that the message is spam.

## Exercise 2: Configuring client access policies
  
### Scenario
  
A. Datum wants to be able to restrict some options for Outlook on the Web and mobile clients. You need to configure policies for Outlook Web App, mobile device access, and mailboxes. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure an Outlook Web App policy

2. Configure mobile-device access

3. Configure a mailbox policy for mobile devices 

4. Validate mobile-device management policies (optional)



#### Task 1: Configure an Outlook Web App policy

5. On LON-CL2, sign out of Outlook on the web, and then sign in again as  **Kendra@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**, where *yyxxxxx* is your unique Adatum number, with the password you created in Module 1.

6. Verify that Kendra is unable to access the attachment in the new message.

>  **Note:** In some cases, it may take a few minutes for the new Outlook Web App mailbox policy to take effect.


#### Task 2: Configure mobile-device access
  
1. On LON-CL1, in the Exchange admin center, browse to  **mobile device access** in **mobile**.

  -  **Allows simple passwords**
  -  **Minimum password length** of **4**



#### Task 4: Validate mobile-device management policies (optional)
  
1. On your mobile device, add a new ActiveSync account for Francisco Chaves.

2. If Autodiscover does not detect the server name, enter  **outlook.office365.com**.

3. Your device will be placed into quarantine, and you must approve the device before you can send and receive messages.

4. After you configure the Exchange ActiveSync account, the security settings from the mobile device mailbox policy will apply, and you may be prompted to create a password on your device.

5. When you are done testing, you can delete the account from your mobile device.

6. Leave the virtual machines running for the next lab.


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have configured client access policies.
