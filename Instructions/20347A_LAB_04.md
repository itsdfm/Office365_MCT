# Module 4: Planning and configuring directory synchronization
# Lab: Configuring directory synchronization
  
### Scenario
  
 The pilot deployment of Office 365 is well underway at A. Datum. The project steering committee has made the recommendation to continue with migrating additional departments to Office 365. The first step in completing the migration is to configure directory synchronization so that user and group accounts will be synchronized for the on-premises AD DS domain rather than managing all user and group accounts in Office 365.


### Objectives
  
 After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Prepare the on-premises AD DS domain for directory synchronization.
- Install and configure directory synchronization with Azure AD Connect.
- Manage user and group accounts by using directory synchronization.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Use the lab steps provided by the hosting partner when completing the labs in this course.

## Exercise 1: Preparing for directory synchronization
  
### Scenario
  
Before directory synchronization can be configured, there are several checks that the team needs to run, including identifying duplicate accounts in AD DS, filtering the directory, correcting UPNs, and enabling directory synchronization in Office 365.

In this exercise, you will prepare the environment for directory synchronization. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure UPN

2. Prepare problem user accounts

3. Run the IdFix tool and fix identified issues

4. Configure the Office 365 tenant for directory synchronization



#### Task 1: Configure UPN
  
1. On LON-DC1, open Active Directory Domains and Trusts, and add Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com as an Alternate UPN Suffix.

2. Using Windows PowerShell, update the UPN on every user in AD DS with "@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com" for the domain name. To do this, type the following command and then press Enter:

    ```
    Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties SamAccountName | foreach { Set-ADUser $_ -UserPrincipalName ($_.SamAccountName + "@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com" )}
    ```



#### Task 2: Prepare problem user accounts
  
1. On LON-DC1, set the Execution policy in Windows PowerShell to Unrestricted, change the path to  **C:\\labfiles**, and then run the Windows PowerShell cmdlet  **.\\CreateProblemUsers.ps1**.

2. This Windows PowerShell script will make the following changes in AD DS:

    - Klemen Sic. Add the "@" character to the beginning of "adatum" for the  **UserPrincipalName** attribute.
    - Lara Raisic. Replace the existing string with "lara@adatum.com" for the  **EmailAddress** attribute.
    - Logan Boyle. Replace the existing string with "lara@adatum.com" for the  **EmailAddress** attribute.
    - Holly Spencer. Replace the existing string with "holly @adatum.com" for the  **EmailAddress** attribute.
    - Maj Hojski. Replace the existing string with " " for the  **EmailAddress** attribute.



#### Task 3: Run the IdFix tool and fix identified issues
  
1. On LON-CL1, download the IdFix DirSync Error Remediation Tool from  [**https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36832**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36832)

2. Extract the files to  **C:\\Deployment Tools\\IdFix**, and then run IDFix as an administrator. 

3. In the IdFix tool, click  **Query**, and then sort the errors by the ERROR column.

4. On the  **Actions** menu, select **Edit** for each of these objects, and then click **Apply**:

    - Klemen Sic
    - Holly Spencer
    - Maj Hojski

5. Click ** Query**.

6. Click to sort the errors by the UPDATE column, and for each of these objects, replace the  **mail** attribute with the appropriate string. On the **Actions** menu, select **EDIT**.

    - Logan Boyle.  **mail** attribute should be "logan@adatum.com".
    - Maj Hojski.  **mail** attribute should be "maj@adatum.com".

7. Click  **Apply**, and then click  **Query**.

8. Remediate any remaining issues.



#### Task 4: Configure the Office 365 tenant for directory synchronization
  
1. On LON-CL1, open Windows Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell and connect to MSOnline with the following credentials:

    - User name:  **Holly@Adatumyyxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com**
    - Password:  The password you created in Module 1

2. In Windows PowerShell, enable directory synchronization for Office 365 by using the following command:

    ```
    Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled -EnableDirSync $true -Force
    ```

3. In Windows PowerShell, check the status of directory synchronization for Office 365 by using the following command:

    ```
    (Get-MsolCompanyInformation).DirectorySynchronizationEnabled
    ``` 

4. In the Office 365 admin center, verify that directory synchronization has been enabled. 

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you will have resolved issues in AD DS identified by the IdFix tool and you will have enabled Active Directory synchronization in Office 365. 


## Exercise 2: Configuring directory synchronization
  
### Scenario
