# Module 2: Managing Office 365 users and groups
# Lab A: Managing Office 365 users and passwords
  
### Scenario
  
 After configuring an Office 365 tenant and preparing it for pilot deployment, you are now ready to start creating user and group accounts in Office 365. You and your team need to be familiar with how to configure these accounts by using the Office 365 admin center because this will be your primary tool for managing the environment after the deployment is fully functional. Additionally, you need to make sure that the password policy for Office 365 users matches the password policy for on-premises users.


### Objectives
  
 After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Manage Office 365 users and licenses by using the Office 365 admin center.

- Manage Office 365 password policies.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Use the lab steps provided by the hosting partner when completing the labs in this course.

 In all of the tasks:

- Where you see references to  **Adatumyyxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com**, replace  **yyxxxxx** with your unique Office 365 name that displays on the online lab portal.
- Where you see references to  **yourdomain.hostdomain.com**, replace the  **yourdomain** with your unique hostdomain.com name that displays on the online lab portal.


 This lab requires the following virtual machines (use only the virtual machines required for your lab):

## Exercise 2: Managing Office 365 password policies
  
### Scenario
  
 Your organization has configured a password policy for on-premises users that requires a complex password, and it requires users to change their passwords every 60 days. You need to ensure that the password policy for the pilot users on Office 365 matches the policy for on-premises users, and you need to report any settings that you cannot configure to match.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure the Office 365 password policy

2. Validate the password policy

3. Enable multi-factor authentication

4. To prepare for the next lab

4. Set the password expiration policy to  **14** days before the passwords expire.

  >  **Note:** This setting does not correspond with a real-world scenario. Use it as a sample scenario to verify the policy applied in the next exercise task.

5. In the  **Days before a user is notified about expiration** box, leave the default value of **14**.

6. Verify that the "Password policy has been updated" message appears at the top of the page.



#### Task 2: Validate the password policy
  
1. Open Microsoft Edge, and then browse to  **https://portal.office.com**.

  >  **Note:** It might take a few minutes before the password change notification appears.

  >  **Note:** You have now verified that your password policy is applied. In a real-world scenario, after you verify that the password policy is applied, you would need to increase the number of days before the password expires, according to your organizational policy.

4. Close Microsoft Edge.



#### Task 3: Enable multi-factor authentication
  
1. Open Microsoft Edge, and then browse to  **https://portal.office.com**.

2. Sign in as  **Holly@Adatumyyxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com**, where *yyxxxxx* is your unique Adatum number, with the password you created in Module 1.

## 
  
**Question** 
After creating a user account, what account settings are available for you to edit in the Active users window of the Office 365 admin center?

**Question** 
What password policy settings are available in Office 365?

**Question** 
List the three types of mail-enabled groups in Exchange Online in Office 365.

**Question** 
What are the administrator roles that you can assign in Office 365?



# Lab B: Managing Office 365 groups and administration
  
### Scenario
  
 In addition to creating user accounts, you also need to know how to create group accounts in Office 365. In this pilot project, you will use Windows PowerShell commands to manage users and groups. If the pilot is successful, you can manage several hundred users and groups, and Windows PowerShell will be a means to manage them efficiently. One of the goals in the pilot project is to test delegated administration in Office 365, so you also need to delegate password management and billing management to different users.


### Objectives
  
 After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Manage Office 365 groups by using the Office 365 admin center.
- Manage Office 365 users and groups by using Windows PowerShell.
- Configure delegated administrators.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Use the lab steps provided by the hosting partner when completing the labs in this course.
