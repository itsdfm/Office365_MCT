#### Task 3: Run the IdFix tool and fix identified issues
  
1. On LON-CL1, open Microsoft Edge, and then connect to  [**https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36832**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36832)

2. On the IdFix DirSync Error Remediation Tool page, click  **Download**.

3. Wait for the download to complete, and then click  **Open**.

12. In the Holly Spencer row, in the  **ACTION** column, select **EDIT.**

13. In the Maj Hojski row, in the  **ACTION** column, select **EDIT**

14. On the toolbar, click  **Apply**.

15. In the  **Apply Pending** dialog box, click **Yes**; note the  **COMPLETE** status in the **ACTION** column indicating successful writes.

16. Switch to  **File Explorer**, and in the  **C:\\Deployment Tools\\IdFix** folder, double-click **Verbose &lt;date&gt; &lt;time&gt;.txt** to view the updated transactions in the transaction log.

17. Switch back to the IdFix tool.

18. On the toolbar, click  **Query**.

21.  On the toolbar, click **Apply**.

22. In the  **Apply Pending** box, click **Yes**.

23. On the toolbar, click  **Query** and verify that errors are corrected.

>  **Note:** Where there are format and duplicate errors for distinguished names, the UPDATE column either contains the same string as the VALUE column, or the UPDATE column entry is blank; in either case, this means that IdFix cannot suggest a remediation for the error.
> You can either fix these errors outside IdFix, or manually remediate them within IdFix. You can also export the results and use Windows PowerShell to remediate a large number of errors.


#### Task 4: Configure the Office 365 tenant for directory synchronization
  
1.  On LON-CL1, on the desktop, double-click Windows Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell.

2. At the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, type the following command, and press Enter after each:

  ```
  $msolcred = Get-Credential
  ```

4. At the  **Windows PowerShell** prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Connect-MsolService -Credential $msolcred
  ```

12. In the  **Groups** list, select the Project Team group.

  >  **Note:** In the right pane, notice that **Edit Members** is unavailable. This is because group membership is maintained by Active Directory. To view the membership, you need to use Windows PowerShell.

13. On LON-DS1, in Windows PowerShell, type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Get-MsolGroup
  ```

14. Verify that you see Research and Project Team groups. Copy the ObjectID value for these two groups.

15. To verify that you updated the group membership in AD DS, type the following command at the Windows PowerShell prompt, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Get-MsolGroupMember -GroupObjectId <ObjectID for Research group>
